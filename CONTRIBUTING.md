# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Contributions are welcome.

## How to contribute
- Open an issue for bugs, fixes, or feature requests.
- Start a discussion if you want feedback or are unsure about scope.
- Send a PR for small, well-scoped changes.

## PR acceptance notes
The codebase and design are still stabilizing. Some PRs may be deferred or declined until the architecture settles further. Opening an issue or discussion first helps align on approach.

## Development basics
- Follow the repo guidelines in `AGENTS.md` (tests, docs, changelog).
- Keep changes scoped and avoid unrelated refactors.
